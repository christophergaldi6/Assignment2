Assignment 2

Description:
Welcome to the Game of Life, a program that simulates life by allowing text documents and random assignments to populate the grid.
Code has approximately 20 errors. I couldn't figure out where to fix it and Brady and our older computer science friends tried to change some things but they weren't helping change it.
